1.  Building and linking a kernel
2.  Caches and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
3.  Memory allocation
4.  Interrupts
5.  Processor exception table
6.  Scheduling
7.  Symetric Multi-Processing (SMP)
8.  Synchronization and memory ordering
9.  System calls
10. Virtual memory, the Memory Management Unit, and user-space page tables
11. Work queues and wait queues

There are a few prerequisites for this tutorial, including materials and experience. The remainder of this chapter includes these requirements along with some acknowledgements, resources, and a disclaimer.
