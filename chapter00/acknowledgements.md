## Acknowledgements

Developing an OS is difficult. Writing an open ebook about developing an OS is also difficult. I want to acknowledge the giants on whose shoulders we stand.

#### Carter Beauford and Hikaru Nakamura

CheesecakeOS was conceived during the COVID-19 pandemic. Carter Beauford and Hikaru Nakamura are two amazing professionals in their respective (and competitive) fields. They have a way of making their craft appear effortless. Their Twitch streams and YouTube videos were an essential source of motivation.

#### Linus Torvalds

Inventor or Linux, one of the greatest gifts to humanity. Operating system development, at least for this humble baker, would be impossible without such a resource. The fact that the world's most popular enterprise OS is freely available for limitless study (and copying) is a true treat I am thankful for. Any resemblance between the CheesecakeOS source and Linux is not-at-all coincidental. The Linux Kernel was the go-to for understanding and verification of the implementation.


#### Randall Bryant and David O'Hallaron

Authors of Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective. My favorite book of all time. I rate it as the best book for aspiring software engineers. Understanding this book will raise the student from code-monkey-chump to core-developer-champ. They provide a world-class explanation of the compilation process, mapping from the C programming language to assembly language, and the services a user should expect an operating system to provide. I consider reading this book and completing the labs to be prerequisites. These guys are true heroes.

#### Sergey Matyukevich

Creator of the Raspberry Pi OS educational github repository. This repository was, luckily, my first introduction to OS development. It served as the inspiration for the CheesecakeOS project. It should come as no surprise to see major parallels between CheesecakeOS and his Raspberrry Pi OS.

#### Will Deacon

In addition to having his name all over the ARM Linux implementation (and, as a result, acting as the reference source for good chunks of CheesecakeOS), Will has written documentation and given at least one talk that helped me come to terms with atomics and ordering. To be honest, I am still quite shaky on the subject, but *_way_* ahead of where I would be otherwise. Will also seems extra super matey, and I would be extra super flattered to buy him a delicious beverage of his favorite temperament and temperature, if the opportunity ever presented itself. Thanks Will!

#### Women

Wonderful beings whose existence is a constant source of inspiration.
