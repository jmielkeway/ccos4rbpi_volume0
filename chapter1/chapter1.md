## Chapters[1]: Hello, Cheesecake!

Our aim in this chapter is to get up and running with our own primitive OS build. Quick and dirty is ok. We want to prove we have a valid execution environment from which we can build further operating system services.

- [Hello, Cheescake!](hello-cheesecake.md) shows the very first CheesecakeOS build. After loading it on to the RaspberryPi and confirming the output, we examine the code instruction by instruction.
- [Conventions and Design](conventions-and-design.md) exposes the structure of our program along with a bit of a refactor.
- [Building](building.md) covers the Makefile for the project.
- [Linking](linking.md) discusses the rudiments of the linker script.
- [Logging](logging.md) demonstrates a fun implemenation of formatted output that, while having little to do with operating system development itself, will prove an invaluable troubleshooting tool as we make our way though this tutorial.
