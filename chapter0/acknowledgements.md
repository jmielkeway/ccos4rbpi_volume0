Writing an operating system is hard. Writing an open ebook about an operating system is also hard.

#### Randall Bryant and David O'Hallaron

Authors of Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective. I rate it as the best book for aspiring software engineers. In my humble opinion, understanding this book will lift the reader from code-monkey-chump to core-developer-champ. They provide a world-class explanation of the compilation process and the mapping from the C programming language to assmbler. They provide world-class explanations of many other concepts as well. I consider reading this book and completing the labs to be prerequisites. These guys are true heroes.

#### Sergey Matyukevich

Creator of the Raspberry Pi OS educational github repository. This repository was, luckily, my first introduction to OS development. It served as the inspiration for the CheesecakeOS project. When I read Sergey's introduction, I conclude he hopes his project will grant readers and participants a good learning experience. It is my hope the CheesecakeOS project proves he was successful. It should come as no surprise to see major paralells between CheesecakeOS and his Raspberrry Pi OS. I am in no way ashamed to admit many ideas (as well as a material amount of code) contained here were lifted from there.

#### Linus Tovralds

Inventer or Linux, one of the greatest gifts to humanity. Operating system development, at least for this author, would be impossible without such a resource. The fact that the world's most popular enterprise OS is freely available for limitless study (and copying) is a true treat I am thankful for.

#### Will Deacon

In addition to having his name all over the ARM Linux implementation (and, as a result, acting as the reference source for good chunks of CheesecakeOS), Will has written documentation and given at least one talk that helped me come to terms with atomics and ordering. To be honest, I am still quite shaky on the subject, but *_way_* ahead of where I would be otherwise. Will also seems extra super matey, and I would be extra super flattered to buy him a delicious beverage of his favorite temperment and temperature, if the opportunity ever presented itself. Thanks Will!

#### Women

Wonderful beings whose mere existance is a constant source of inspiration.
