## Chapters[1]: Hello, Cheesecake!

> Note: [this copyright notice](../COPYRIGHT_CHAPTER_ONE) applies to Chapter One

Our aim in this chapter is to get up and running with our own primitive OS build. Quick and dirty is ok. We want to prove we have a valid execution environment from which we can build further operating system services.

- [Hello, Cheesecake!](hello-cheesecake.md) shows the very first CheesecakeOS build. After loading it on to the Raspberry Pi 4 and confirming the output, we examine the boot source code in depth.
- [Conventions, Design, Building, and Linking](conventions-design-building-linking.md) exposes the design of our program after a bit of a refactor. After reviewing the coding conventions, we step through the project's Makefile. The slice ends with a rundown of the linker script.
- [Logging](logging.md) demonstrates a fun implementation of formatted output. The logger function will prove an invaluable troubleshooting tool as we make our way though this volume.
